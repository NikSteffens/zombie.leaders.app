# Zombie Leaders Control App

Local browser app to run the Zombie Leaders game flow:

- Randomly assign up to 24 players into:
  - `1-4` Zombie Leaders (who know each other)
  - Remaining Organizational Citizens (with optional special roles)
- Configure player count directly (with optional name list; missing names auto-fill as `Player 1..N`)
- Reveal each role card privately on demand
- Generate role-aware scripts for:
  - Orientation (optional for first-time players)
  - Introduction
  - Day sequence
- Play scripts as spoken audio using browser text-to-speech
  - `Recommended` voice mode filters to stable local English voices first
  - Defaults to `Daniel` voice when available
  - Includes a voice test button and adjustable voice speed/pitch
- Run a generated zombie-sound night ambience to mask player noise
  - Includes 20 selectable background soundscapes (wind, rain, melody, industrial, zombie, etc.)

## Notes

- Role scripts automatically change based on which special roles are actually assigned.
- The night sequence audio is synthesized in-browser (Web Audio API), so no external files are required.
