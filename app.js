    "Welcome to Happy Days Corporation (HDC) — an organization where we like to put the smile on everyone’s faces and keep it there. I’m the Departmental Administrator and my goal is to make your time here as fulfilling and rewarding as possible. Unfortunately, as you are about to find out, there are some extreme structural constraints that limit my ability to do this. Historically, as our name suggests, we have been a very happy organization. Our leaders worked hard to create, advance, represent and embed a sense of shared identity among employees. As a result, this was a place where people enjoyed their work and were both healthy and productive. But HDC has recently been going through a tough time. Things started going downhill after some of our senior executives went on a shonky Leadership Development course last year. This led to them being infected with a toxic mindset that researchers have identified as arising from an approach to management known as ZOMBIE LEADERSHIP.",
    "Devotees of Zombie Leadership — known as Zombie Leaders — are committed to the idea that leaders are inherently superior to everyone else and hence that they are natural leaders. They think that everything they do is right, that they alone know how best to do things, that everyone can see how wonderful they are, and that they should be extravagantly rewarded for the work they do. Sadly, HDC now has a number of Zombie Leaders in its top ranks. Precisely how many there are of them is unknown — but they are in the process of destroying our organization. If the Zombie Leaders destroy the organization, they will have won.",
    "But the good news is, there are still plenty of decent, sensible people working here.",
    "Finally, we have a number of Organizational Citizens. They are the backbone of HDC and they have been serving the company loyally for a great many years. We are grateful for their service but mindful that the Zombie Leaders are always looking for ways to reduce their ranks — while at the same time taking credit for everything they achieve.",
    "The big question, then, is whether we can save ourselves from the impending Zombie Leadership Apocalypse. Let us not go quietly into that dark night.",
  ],
  intro: [
    "The first thing I’d like to do is work out what role everyone has, because, after the last restructure that the Zombie Leaders initiated everyone — including me — is very confused. And because some of this information is secret, I’d also like everyone to close your eyes. First, I’d like the Zombie Leaders to open your eyes and acknowledge each other.",
    "You are dirtbags and proud of it.",
    "Now please close your eyes.",
    "Now could the Sycophant please open your eyes and look at me. Now Zombie Leaders please keep your eyes closed but just raise your hands.",
    "Sycophant, take note of the Zombie Leaders with their hands raised. Now Zombie Leaders please put your hands down. Sycophant please close your eyes and do your worst.",
    "Now could the Integrity Officer open your eyes and look at me please. Thank you and good luck. Please close your eyes.",
    "Now could the Personnel Manager please open your eyes and look at me. Thank you and good luck. Please close your eyes.",
    "Now IT Specialist open your eyes and look at me please. Thank you and good luck. Please close your eyes.",
    "Now could the Training Supervisor open your eyes and look at me please. Thank you and good luck. Please close your eyes.",
    "Now could the Schoßhündchen (Boss’s Pet) open your eyes and look at me please. Thank you and good luck. Please close your eyes.",
    "Now could the Social Club Organiser open your eyes and look at me please. Thank you and good luck. Please close your eyes.",
    "Now could the Office Gossip open your eyes and look at me please. Thank you and good luck. Please close your eyes.",
    "Now could the Matchmaker open your eyes and look at me. Can you point to two people who you would like to fall in love with each other?",
    "Thank you — you can close your eyes. Now if I tap you on the knee, please open your eyes and gaze upon your new life partner. Your fates will now be inextricably intertwined — so if one of you leaves us, the other will too.",
    "Now please close your eyes and commit yourselves to a future in which you are bound together in perpetuity.",
    "Now could the Union Reps open your eyes and identify each other. You have a difficult job ahead of you and you will need to work as a united force. Your strength lies in your solidarity and your unwavering commitment to the AntiZombie Leadership Alliance. Remember, you are fighting for fairness, for dignity, and for a better future — but you can never speak of this endeavour. Thank you. And now please close your eyes.",
    "Finally, could the Organizational Citizens please keep your eyes closed and raise your hands so that I can see who you are?",
    "Thank you.",
    "We are now ready to get to work.",
    "This is a new day at Happy Days Corporation and the first thing I’d like you to do is elect a Head of Department. This person is going to be in charge of your meetings and they will also have the deciding vote if any votes are tied. So, as always, you need to choose this leader wisely.",
  ],
  day: [
    "We would like you to have a discussion to see if there is anyone you would like to remove from the organization because you suspect them of being a Zombie Leader. You can also choose not to remove anyone, but that decision must be unanimous. This will be the last thing we do today before we go to bed.",
  ],
  night: [
    "The day has faded into night.",
    "Could the Training Supervisor open your eyes and let me know who you would like to send on mandatory training tomorrow. Tomorrow’s course promises to be very exciting and is on",
    "Thank you. Please close your eyes.",
    "Now could the Social Club Organiser open your eyes and let me know if you want to use your one chance to go on a 24-hour excursion and, if so, who you would like to take with you.",
    "Thank you. Please close your eyes.",
    "Now could the Office Gossip please open your eyes and look at me. If your career is destroyed by the Zombie Leaders tonight, is there anyone you would like to take down with you?",
    "Thank you. Please close your eyes.",
    "Now, finally, could the Intern open your eyes and let me know who, if anyone, you would like to have as your mentor for the next 24 hours.",
    "Thank you. Please close your eyes.",
    "Thank you everyone for your work today. It’s now time for everyone to get a good night’s rest, as it’s going to be another busy day tomorrow.",
    "So please close your eyes.",
    "It’s now time for the Zombie Leaders to get to work.",
    "Zombie Leaders, open your eyes. Your task is to identify one person whose position in HDC you will terminate (typically someone you see as the greatest threat, or to throw the Organizational Citizens off your scent). Please remain silent and use only non-verbal communication to agree on your next victim. Once you have reached an agreement, silently point to the person you wish to remove from the organization.",
    "Thank you. Please close your eyes.",
